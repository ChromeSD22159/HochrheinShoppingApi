# Welcome to Hochrhein Shopping Api!

This project is based on Ktor, a lightweight framework for building web applications in Kotlin.

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Create Required Files**:
    - Create a `version.txt` file in the root directory.
    - Create a `.env` file with the following parameters:
      ```
      DB_PORT=<Port>
      DB_NAME=<Database Name>
      DB_HOST=<Database Host>
      DB_USERNAME=<Database Username>
      DB_PASSWORD=<Database Password>

      EXCHANGE = <Key>
      WEATHER =  <Key>
      ROUTE = <Key>
      ```

## Deployment
